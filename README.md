# For Developers

IMPORTANT!!!

**FIRST**. If you have modified source code you need to compile it with babel:
```bash
npm run babel
```
This will regenerate file in `dist` folder.

**SECOND**. If you want to modify scheme of database, you must do it only in one place `db.scheme.js`.
After that you need to generate source code for a graphql type definitions and for resolvers JavaScript code.
You can do it with:
```bash
npm run gen-ql
```
